## 🌿 Overview

**Verdant Bond Protocol** is a blockchain-native green finance instrument built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) network. It issues bonds where **coupon payments are denominated in carbon credits and biodiversity credits** rather than fiat currency — directly linking investor returns to the ecological performance of real-world nature-based projects.

Each bond tranche is backed by a specific, verifiable reforestation, blue carbon (mangrove, seagrass, wetland), or biodiversity restoration project. Smart contracts automate the entire bond lifecycle, while on-chain oracles provide tamper-resistant proof of carbon stock growth.

This is not merely a carbon offset product. It is a **financial primitive** — a programmable, tradeable, yield-bearing instrument whose yield is the planet healing. It combines the structural familiarity of traditional fixed-income instruments with the transparency, composability, and accessibility of decentralized finance.

## 🔍 Why This Exists

### The Problem with Green Finance Today

The global voluntary carbon market exceeded **$2 billion** in 2023 and is projected to reach **$50 billion by 2030**. Yet the infrastructure underpinning it is plagued by:

- **Opacity** — Investors cannot trace the direct link between their capital and specific ecological outcomes
- **Illiquidity** — Traditional green bonds lock capital for 5–20 years with no meaningful secondary market
- **Integrity failures** — High-profile greenwashing scandals have eroded trust in carbon credits
- **Access barriers** — Minimum investment sizes ($100,000+) exclude retail and emerging-market investors
- **Settlement friction** — Manual credit verification and distribution creates costly delays

### What Verdant Bond Protocol Changes

| Problem                                        | Our Solution                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Carbon credit integrity is hard to verify      | On-chain oracle anchors real project measurements        |
| Green bonds lack coupon-to-impact traceability | Each tranche is 1:1 backed by a single, named project    |
| Bond coupons are illiquid for retail holders   | Stellar DEX enables permissionless secondary trading     |
| Manual settlement is costly and slow           | Soroban contracts automate the full lifecycle            |
| Greenwashing is rampant                        | IPFS-anchored audit trails are permanent and public      |
| Access is limited to institutions              | Tokenization allows fractional ownership from any wallet |

### Our Thesis

> Nature-based solutions represent the single largest untapped carbon sink on Earth. Mobilizing private capital toward them at scale requires instruments that are **credible, liquid, and programmable**. Verdant Bond Protocol is that instrument.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### What is a Nature-based Solution (NbS)?

Nature-based Solutions are actions that protect, sustainably manage, or restore natural ecosystems while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. For the purposes of this protocol, NbS projects include:

- **Reforestation & Afforestation** — Planting native tree species on degraded or deforested land
- **Blue Carbon** — Conserving or restoring coastal ecosystems (mangroves, seagrass beds, saltmarshes) that sequester carbon at rates 3–5x higher than terrestrial forests
- **Avoided Deforestation (REDD+)** — Protecting standing forests from conversion
- **Biodiversity Corridors** — Restoring habitat connectivity to support species migration
- **Regenerative Agriculture** — Transitioning farmland to practices that build soil organic carbon

### What is a Carbon Credit?

A single carbon credit represents **one metric tonne of CO₂ equivalent** (tCO₂e) either sequestered from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted. In Verdant Bond Protocol, carbon credits issued as Stellar Assets are:

- Minted by the `CouponEngine` contract upon verified oracle reports
- Traceable to a specific project and measurement period
- Tradeable on the Stellar DEX
- Permanently retirable on-chain

### What is a Biodiversity Credit?

A biodiversity credit represents a **measurable, verifiable unit of biodiversity outcome** — such as a hectare of restored habitat, or a population increase of a threatened species. Biodiversity credits are an emerging asset class, and Verdant Bond Protocol is architected to accommodate them alongside carbon credits as the market matures.

### Bond Tranche

A bond tranche is a discrete issuance with defined:

- **Face Value** (in XLM or USDC equivalent)
- **Maturity Date**
- **Coupon Schedule** (quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
- **Coupon Currency** (carbon credits, biodiversity credits, or a basket)
- **Backing Project** (a single NbS project registered on-chain)

### Detailed Step-by-Step

#### Step 1 — Project Registration

A project developer submits project documentation (geospatial boundaries, ecological baseline, methodology, legal title) to IPFS. The content hash is registered with the `ProjectRegistry` contract on Stellar. An accredited auditor validates the baseline and co-signs the on-chain record.

#### Step 2 — Bond Tranche Issuance

A bond issuer (project developer, green bank, or SPV) calls `BondIssuer.issue_bond()` specifying the face value, coupon schedule, project backing, and credit type. The contract mints bond tokens and holds them in escrow pending investor subscriptions.

#### Step 3 — Investor Subscription

Investors connect their Stellar wallets, pass KYC (handled off-chain via the NestJS API), and purchase bond tokens. Each token represents a pro-rata claim on the tranche. Minimum subscription is one token (fractional NbS exposure).

#### Step 4 — Continuous Oracle Monitoring

The oracle network continuously monitors carbon stock growth via satellite imagery, IoT sensors, and periodic third-party audits. Signed measurement reports are submitted on-chain to the `OracleConsumer` contract. A report only becomes `Verified` after **independent qualifying sources** endorse it: each qualifying verify call is recorded on-chain and counted against a configurable signature threshold, providers must meet the configured minimum stake before their vote counts, and a provider can never verify its own report. This multi-source consensus makes fabricated measurements economically and cryptographically impractical.

#### Step 5 — Coupon Calculation

At each coupon date, the `CouponEngine` contract reads the verified oracle report **by its on-chain `report_id`** and calculates the total carbon credits earned by the project during that period. Reports that are not `Verified` are rejected, and the report's project must match the bond's registered project. Credits are allocated pro-rata to all bond token holders.

#### Step 6 — Automatic Distribution & Claiming

Coupon distribution runs entirely on-chain, referencing only reports that have passed multi-source verification, and records the `report_id` on-chain for full auditability. Accrued credits are claimed directly to the bondholder's wallet via `claim_credits()` (or the `POST /bonds/:id/claim` API). No manual intervention, no intermediary, no settlement delay.

#### Step 7 — Secondary Market Trading

At any point, investors may list bond tokens on the Stellar DEX. When an order is filled, the `DEXRouter` contract invokes `BondIssuer.transfer()` to move the tokens **on-chain from seller to buyer atomically** — the order status only updates after the token transfer succeeds, eliminating off-ledger settlement risk. Tokens can also be transferred peer-to-peer via `BondIssuer.transfer()` (or the `POST /bonds/:id/transfer` API). Price discovery happens permissionlessly, reflecting market views on project performance.

#### Step 8 — Maturity & Settlement

At maturity, the `BondIssuer` contract returns principal to bondholders and settles any remaining credits. The bond tranche is marked inactive and removed from the active registry.

#### Step 9 — Credit Retirement

Bondholders may retire their carbon credits on-chain, generating a permanent, verifiable retirement certificate. Retired credits are burned and recorded in the public ledger — usable for corporate net-zero reporting.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔗 Smart Contract Bond Lifecycle

The entire bond lifecycle — issuance, coupon accrual, distribution, maturity, and redemption — is handled by Soroban smart contracts written in Rust. No intermediary, no manual settlement, no counterparty risk. Every state transition is a publicly visible, immutable ledger entry.

### 🌐 Oracle-Driven Performance Verification

An oracle network feeds real-world project data (carbon stock measurements, satellite imagery hashes, third-party audit reports) on-chain. Credit coupon amounts are dynamically calculated based on **actual ecological performance**, not projections. Under-performing projects yield fewer credits; outperforming ones reward bondholders generously.

### 💱 Native Secondary Market Liquidity

Bond tokens and individual credit coupon tokens are standard **Stellar Assets**, making them natively compatible with the Stellar DEX. No bridges, no wrapped assets, no additional smart contract risk — just native Stellar primitives trading in a permissionless marketplace.

### 🌱 Fractional Green Exposure

Tokenization allows **fractional ownership** of bond tranches, opening nature-based finance to retail investors who couldn't access traditional green bond minimums (often $100,000+). Any wallet, any size.

### 📄 IPFS-Backed Immutable Documentation

All project prospectuses, audit reports, satellite data, and legal documentation are stored on **IPFS** with content hashes anchored on-chain. Documents are permanent, tamper-proof, and publicly accessible — making greenwashing technically impossible.

### 🛰️ Multi-Source Oracle Architecture

Carbon stock data is sourced from multiple independent providers: certified auditors, satellite imagery processors, and IoT sensor networks. Multi-source consensus prevents single points of failure or manipulation.

### 🔐 Nonce-Based Replay Protection

All sensitive contract interactions are protected by nonce-based replay protection. Each signed transaction consumes a unique nonce, preventing double-spend attacks, replay attacks, and front-running across the protocol.

### 🌊 Blue Carbon Support

The protocol is purpose-built to support blue carbon projects — coastal ecosystems that sequester carbon at 3–5x the rate of terrestrial forests but have been chronically underfunded due to measurement complexity. Verdant Bond Protocol's oracle architecture handles the unique measurement methodologies of blue carbon science.

### 🤝 CarbonChain Integration

Built as a composable layer on top of CarbonChain's existing credit infrastructure, the protocol reuses battle-tested oracle feeds, IPFS anchoring patterns, and DEX integrations — dramatically reducing time-to-market and smart contract surface area.

## 📜 Smart Contract Design

The protocol is composed of six primary Soroban contracts deployed on Stellar:

---

### `BondIssuer`

Handles bond creation, tranche configuration, and investor token minting. The issuer contract is the entry point for all new bond tranches.

```rust
// Bond configuration structure
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct BondConfig {
    pub project_id: BytesN<32>,      // IPFS content hash of project docs
    pub face_value: i128,            // In stroops (XLM) or USDC
    pub coupon_schedule: Vec<u64>,   // Unix timestamps for each coupon date
    pub credit_type: CreditType,     // Carbon | Biodiversity | Basket
    pub maturity_date: u64,
    pub total_supply: i128,          // Total bond tokens to mint
}

// Issue a new bond tranche
pub fn issue_bond(
    env: Env,
    issuer: Address,
    config: BondConfig,
) -> BondId { ... }

// Investor subscribes to a tranche
pub fn subscribe(
    env: Env,
    investor: Address,
    bond_id: BondId,
    amount: i128,
    nonce: u64,
) -> Result<(), BondError> { ... }
```

Maturity is **time-based**: `mature_bond` is rejected before the bond's `maturity_date` is reached, and once that date elapses `subscribe` and `transfer` are also rejected so the outstanding supply is frozen on schedule. Redemption still requires the explicit `Matured` state.

---

### `CouponEngine`

Calculates and distributes credit coupons to bondholders based on oracle-reported performance data. The engine reads verified measurement reports and converts raw carbon stock growth figures into distributable credit tokens.

```rust
// Oracle measurement report (signed by approved data provider)
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct OracleReport {
    pub project_id: BytesN<32>,
    pub period_start: u64,
    pub period_end: u64,
    pub carbon_sequestered: i128,    // In kg CO2e
    pub biodiversity: BiodiversityMetrics,
    pub methodology: Symbol,
    pub provider_signature: BytesN<64>,
    pub ipfs_evidence_hash: BytesN<32>,
}

// Optional biodiversity metrics attached to a report
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum BiodiversityMetrics {
    Absent,
    Present((i128, i128, i128)), // (habitat_area_ha, species_abundance, biodiversity_units)
}

// Distribute coupon for a given period (report referenced by on-chain report_id)
pub fn distribute_coupon(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    bond_id: BondId,
    period: u32,
    holders: Vec<Address>,
    report_id: ReportId,     // must reference a Verified oracle report
    nonce: u64,
) -> CouponResult { ... }

// Admin sweeps integer-division remainder that holders could not be allocated
pub fn sweep_undistributed(env: Env, caller: Address, bond_id: BondId, nonce: u64) -> i128 { ... }

// Query accrued credits for a bondholder
pub fn accrued_credits(
    env: Env,
    bond_id: BondId,
    holder: Address,
) -> i128 { ... }

// Query accrued credits for a bondholder, split by credit type
pub fn accrued_credits_by_type(
    env: Env,
    bond_id: BondId,
    holder: Address,
    credit_type: CreditType,
) -> i128 { ... }
```

Credit allocation is **methodology-aware**: the credit type stored on the bond (`BondConfig.credit_type`, captured by `register_bond`) determines how raw report figures are converted into credits.

- `Carbon` bonds: `credits = carbon_sequestered_kg / 1_000` (1 credit per tonne).
- `Biodiversity` bonds: credits from habitat area, species abundance, and biodiversity units via per-methodology rates.
- `Basket` bonds: a combined coupon where carbon and biodiversity credits are accrued **separately per type** (queryable via `accrued_credits_by_type`) while still reported as a combined total in `CouponResult`.

---

### `OracleConsumer`

Validates and ingests signed oracle reports, anchoring real-world ecological data on-chain. Only approved oracle providers may submit reports, and each report is validated against the project's registered methodology.

```rust
// Register an approved oracle provider
pub fn register_provider(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    provider: Address,
    methodology: Symbol,
) -> Result<(), OracleError> { ... }

// Commit / withdraw provider staking collateral
pub fn add_stake(env: Env, provider: Address, amount: i128, nonce: u64) -> Result<(), OracleError> { ... }
pub fn withdraw_stake(env: Env, provider: Address, amount: i128, nonce: u64) -> Result<(), OracleError> { ... }

// Submit a signed measurement report
pub fn submit_report(
    env: Env,
    provider: Address,
    project_id: BytesN<32>,
    period_start: u64,
    period_end: u64,
    carbon_sequestered: i128,
    biodiversity: BiodiversityMetrics,
    methodology: Symbol,
    ipfs_evidence_hash: BytesN<32>,
    nonce: u64,
) -> Result<ReportId, OracleError> { ... }

// Challenge a submitted report (opens 72-hour dispute window)
pub fn challenge_report(
    env: Env,
    challenger: Address,
    report_id: ReportId,
    counter_evidence_hash: BytesN<32>,
) -> Result<(), OracleError> { ... }
```

---

### `DEXRouter`

Manages bond token and coupon credit listings, order routing, and settlement on the Stellar DEX. The router abstracts Stellar's native DEX primitives and provides a unified interface for the Verdant Bond marketplace.

```rust
// Escrow quote assets before trading
pub fn deposit_quote(env, caller, symbol, amount) -> Result<(), DEXError>
pub fn withdraw_quote(env, caller, symbol, amount) -> Result<(), DEXError>
pub fn get_quote_balance(env, address, symbol) -> i128

// List bond tokens for sale on Stellar DEX
pub fn list_bond_tokens(
    env: Env,
    seller: Address,
    bond_id: BondId,
    amount: i128,
    price_per_token: i128,  // In USDC stroops
    nonce: u64,
) -> Result<OrderId, DEXError> { ... }

// Execute a purchase funded from escrowed quote balance
pub fn execute_purchase(
    env: Env,
    buyer: Address,
    order_id: OrderId,
    amount: i128,
    max_price: i128,
    nonce: u64,
) -> Result<(), DEXError> { ... }
```

Purchases are funded from the buyer's escrowed quote balance (`deposit_quote`); a fill atomically transfers both bond tokens and the escrowed quote so a purchase either fully settles or fully reverts.

---

### `ProjectRegistry`

Maintains the canonical on-chain registry of all NbS projects eligible for bond backing. Projects must pass an approval process before a bond tranche may reference them.

---

### `CreditRetirement`

Handles the permanent on-chain retirement of carbon and biodiversity credits. Retired credits are burned and a retirement certificate NFT is issued to the retiring wallet — usable for corporate net-zero disclosures.

---

## 🛰️ Oracle & Project Performance

The integrity of this protocol depends entirely on the quality and trustworthiness of its ecological data. Verdant Bond Protocol employs a **multi-source, multi-layer oracle architecture**:

### Data Sources

| Source                                     | Type                     | Frequency  | Use                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Accredited Auditors (Verra, Gold Standard) | Third-party verification | Annual     | Baseline & periodic verification                  |
| Satellite Imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat)    | Remote sensing           | Monthly    | NDVI, biomass proxy, deforestation alerts         |
| IoT Sensors                                | In-situ measurement      | Continuous | Soil carbon, water table, microclimate            |
| Blue Carbon Surveys                        | Plot-level measurement   | Seasonal   | Mangrove/seagrass/saltmarsh biomass & soil carbon |
| Community Monitors                         | Ground truth             | Quarterly  | Species surveys, canopy cover                     |

### Oracle Security Model

1. **Provider Whitelisting** — Only addresses registered by the protocol admin may submit reports to `OracleConsumer`
2. **Multi-signature Validation** — Reports default to a 2-signature verification threshold, and provider verifications count only when the provider is active and meets the configured minimum verifier stake
3. **Challenge Window** — Any stakeholder may challenge a submitted report within 72 hours by submitting counter-evidence (IPFS hash)
4. **Dispute Resolution** — Challenged reports are frozen pending review by the protocol's dispute committee; coupons are held in escrow during disputes
5. **Staking & Slashing** — Providers commit staked collateral via `add_stake`; a challenge resolved to `Rejected` slashes **10%** of that stake, and a provider whose stake reaches zero is deactivated and loses whitelist status. Exonerated providers (`Verified` verdict) are not penalized.

### Performance Calculation

Credit coupons are calculated as:

```
credits_per_period = (carbon_sequestered_kg / 1000) * credit_conversion_factor
bondholder_credits = credits_per_period * (bondholder_tokens / total_tokens)
```

Where `credit_conversion_factor` is set at bond issuance and reflects the methodology's conversion ratio between measured biomass growth and certified carbon credits.

---

## 🌐 Oracle Adapters

The standalone adapters in `oracle/` poll real upstream endpoints, validate every response against a documented schema, and produce IPFS-anchored measurement reports whose fields mirror the on-chain `Report` struct (`period_start`, `period_end`, `carbon_sequestered`, `methodology`, `ipfs_evidence_hash`).

### Adapters

| Adapter        | File                            | Upstream                                                         | Methodology      | Input schema (`oracle/schemas.ts`)                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verra registry | `oracle/verra-adapter.ts`       | `VERRA_REGISTRY_URL` (Verra-compatible VCS registry)             | `VERRA-VCS`      | `VerraProjectSchema`, `VerraMonitoringReportSchema`       |
| Satellite      | `oracle/satellite-processor.ts` | `SATELLITE_API_URL` (Sentinel-2 / Landsat NDVI stats)            | `REMOTE-SENSING` | `SatelliteSceneSchema`, `SatelliteProjectConfigSchema`    |
| IoT            | `oracle/iot-aggregator.ts`      | `IOT_API_URL` (in-situ soil sensors)                             | `IOT-SENSORS`    | `IoTSensorReadingSchema`, `IotProjectConfigSchema`        |
| Blue carbon    | `oracle/blue-carbon-adapter.ts` | `BLUE_CARBON_API_URL` (mangrove/seagrass/saltmarsh plot surveys) | `BLUE-CARBON`    | `BlueCarbonSurveySchema`, `BlueCarbonProjectConfigSchema` |

All four validate their inputs **before** producing a report; a response that violates its schema raises a typed error (`VerraSchemaError`, `SatelliteSchemaError`, `IotSchemaError`, `BlueCarbonSchemaError`) and no report is emitted. The output of every adapter is validated against `OracleReportSchema` (see `ipfs/schemas/oracle-report.schema.json`) before it is returned. In the NestJS API, `IOT-SENSORS` is registered via `IotProvider` (`api/src/oracle/providers/iot.provider.ts`) and can be enabled during oracle polling via `ENABLE_IOT_PROVIDER=true`.

### On-Chain Pre-flight Validation

To prevent adapters from wasting transaction fees by submitting reports that are syntactically valid but violate strict on-chain conditions, the `oracle` package implements a shared pre-flight validator (`oracle/validator.ts`). This mirrors the exact rules enforced by `OracleConsumer.submit_report` in the smart contract (e.g., non-negative sequestration, strict `Symbol` regex for methodologies, and IPFS CIDv0 format checking).

Every report generated by an adapter is automatically passed through this validator. If an adapter produces a report that would be rejected on-chain, it immediately throws an `OracleValidationError` before any transaction is signed. You can run `npm test` in the `oracle` directory to ensure all adapters correctly pass the pre-flight checks against mock fixtures.

### Report format

```json
{
  "project_id": "VCS-1234",
  "provider": "VerraRegistry",
  "methodology": "VERRA_VCS",
  "period_start": "2025-01-01",
  "period_end": "2025-03-31",
  "carbon_sequestered": 50000,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "ipfs_evidence_hash": "QmTttqvnJq63tghnv38Uwkd7DWs9NZqfidavoZTisGKX3U",
  "evidence": { "verra_report_ids": ["MR-2024-0112"], "credits_issued": 50 }
}
```

`ipfs_evidence_hash` is a content-addressed IPFS CIDv0: the canonical (key-sorted) JSON of the report is SHA-256 hashed and base58btc-encoded by `ipfs/evidence.ts`, so the hash is deterministic, tamper-evident, and can be pinned to IPFS/Pinata via `uploadEvidence` (requires `IPFS_API_KEY`/`IPFS_SECRET_KEY`). When no pinning credentials are configured, adapters still produce the hash offline — perfect for local development and tests.

### Running each adapter against test data

No network is required. The `oracle/` package ships fixtures in `oracle/testdata/` and a file-backed `HttpClient` (`oracle/run.ts`) that serves them in place of the live endpoints:

```bash
cd oracle
npm install

npm run ingest:verra       # poll Verra registry fixture → OracleReport
npm run ingest:satellite   # ingest NDVI scenes fixture → OracleReport
npm run ingest:iot         # aggregate sensor readings fixture → OracleReport
npm run ingest:blue-carbon # aggregate blue carbon surveys fixture → OracleReport
npm run ingest             # run all four adapters
```

Unit tests mock the upstream HTTP surface (`oracle/test-helpers.ts`) and cover success and error paths (schema violations, 404/500 responses, empty periods, missing credentials):

```bash
cd oracle
npm test                   # jest
npm run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
```

To point an adapter at a live registry instead, set the matching environment variable (`VERRA_REGISTRY_URL`, `SATELLITE_API_URL`, `IOT_API_URL`, `BLUE_CARBON_API_URL`) and call the exported ingest function, e.g. `pollVerraProject('VCS-1234', { periodStart: '2025-01-01', periodEnd: '2025-03-31' })`.

### Measurement models

- **Verra** — sums `carbon_sequestered_kg` across reports whose `verification_status === 'VERIFIED'` and whose reporting period falls inside the requested window.
- **Satellite** — averages NDVI over scenes with cloud cover ≤ 20%, converts the change from `baseline_ndvi` into kg CO2e using a simplified IPCC Tier 1 factor (`area_ha × ndvi_change × 3.67 tC/ha × 44/12`). The factor is a methodology placeholder and must be tuned per project.
- **IoT** — validates each reading, aggregates soil moisture/temperature/humidity/water table, and estimates sequestration from the per-device mean change in soil organic carbon (ppm) over the period: `Δppm × area_ha × 15.4 kg CO2e·ha⁻¹·ppm⁻¹` (assumes 1.4 t/m³ bulk density, 0.3 m sampling depth). Devices without a start/end reading contribute no delta.
- **Blue carbon** — aggregates seasonal plot surveys and estimates net sequestration from the change in mean carbon stock (aboveground biomass + belowground biomass via the project's root-to-shoot ratio + soil organic carbon) against the project baseline: `Δstock_t·ha⁻¹ × area_ha × 44/12 × 1000 kg CO2e`. Periods where the stock falls below baseline contribute zero credits.

## 🌱 Credit Types Supported

### Carbon Credits (tCO₂e)

Standard carbon credits representing verified carbon sequestration or avoidance. Measured in metric tonnes of CO₂ equivalent. Compatible with:

- Verra VCS (Verified Carbon Standard)
- Gold Standard
- American Carbon Registry (ACR)
- Climate Action Reserve (CAR)

### Biodiversity Credits

Emerging credit type representing measurable biodiversity outcomes. Units vary by methodology:

- Habitat hectares restored
- Species Abundance Index (SAI) improvement
- Biodiversity Unit (UK BNG methodology)

### Blue Carbon Credits

Credits from coastal and marine ecosystems — mangroves, seagrass beds and saltmarshes — that sequester carbon at 3–5x the rate of terrestrial forests. Units are tCO₂e measured against a project baseline carbon stock via plot-level biomass and soil carbon surveys (see [Credit Methodology](./docs/credit-methodology.md)). Compatible with:

- Verra VM0033 (Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration)
- Blue Carbon Initiative methodologies

### Basket Credits

A composite coupon containing a defined ratio of carbon and biodiversity credits. Allows issuers to design instruments aligned with dual-objective projects (e.g., a mangrove restoration that generates both carbon and biodiversity outcomes).

---

## 🔄 Secondary Market

Bond tokens and credit coupon tokens are standard **Stellar Assets**, making them natively compatible with the Stellar DEX. The secondary market is fully permissionless — no protocol approval is needed to list or trade.

### Trading Pairs

| Pair          | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `BOND-XLM`    | Bond tokens priced in XLM                  |
| `BOND-USDC`   | Bond tokens priced in USDC                 |
| `CARBON-USDC` | Carbon credit coupons priced in USDC       |
| `BIO-USDC`    | Biodiversity credit coupons priced in USDC |
| `CARBON-BOND` | Credits swapped directly for bond tokens   |

### Stellar DEX Features Used

- **Order Book** — Limit and market orders for bond tokens and credit coupons
- **Path Payments** — Investors can purchase bond tokens using any Stellar asset (XLM, USDC, etc.) via Stellar's built-in path-finding
- **CLMM Pools** — Concentrated liquidity pools for deep liquidity on high-volume credit pairs
- **Offers API** — The `DEXRouter` contract creates and manages passive offers for automated credit distribution

## 🔐 Security Model

### Smart Contract Security

| Mechanism                     | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nonce-based replay protection | Every state-changing call consumes a unique nonce per address   |
| Access control                | Admin functions protected by governance multisig + timelock     |
| Re-entrancy guards            | State updates before external calls throughout                  |
| Integer overflow protection   | Rust's native overflow checking in all arithmetic               |
| Admin rotation                | All contracts include `set_admin()` for trustless admin handoff |

### Governance Control Flow

**All operational contracts are adminned by the Governance contract**, implementing a 3-of-5 multisig + 48-hour timelock:

1. **Governance Signers** (3-of-5 consensus required):
   - Project Developers
   - Bond Issuers
   - Oracle Providers
   - Protocol Maintainers
   - Token Holders

2. **Proposal → Vote → Timelock → Execute**:
   - A signer proposes an admin action (e.g., `set_admin()`, `register_provider()`)
   - 3+ signers approve (or 3+ veto) within voting window
   - Approved proposals enter 48-hour cooldown
   - After 48 hours, any account may execute

3. **Affected Contracts**:
   - `ProjectRegistry` — project approval, KYC parameter changes
   - `BondIssuer` — bond configuration, maturity control
   - `CouponEngine` — coupon distribution parameters
   - `OracleConsumer` — oracle provider management, oracle parameters
   - `DEXRouter` — order settlement parameters
   - `CreditRetirement` — retirement transaction oversight

4. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Scripts verify each contract's `get_admin()` returns the Governance address
   - Any admin action must go through governance multisig

### Operational Security

- API signing keys are accessed through a `SigningKeyProvider` abstraction. Development may use env vars or the local file provider; production deployments should back this abstraction with KMS/HSM-backed signing before handling real custodial funds.
- **3-of-5 multisig** required for all contract admin changes
- **48-hour timelock** ensures community can respond to proposed changes
- Public bug bounty program (see [Security Disclosure](#-security-disclosure))
- Quarterly third-party smart contract audits

### Oracle Security

- Provider whitelist with staked collateral (`add_stake` / `withdraw_stake`, 10% slash on rejected challenges)
- 72-hour challenge window on all submitted reports
- Multi-source verification (minimum 2 independent signatures) before `Verified` status
- Dispute resolution via challenge resolution on-chain

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your development machine:

- **Node.js** `v18+` and **npm** `v9+`
- **Rust** (stable toolchain) and **Cargo**
- **Soroban CLI** — `cargo install --locked soroban-cli`
- **Stellar CLI** — see [Stellar docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli)
- **IPFS CLI** or a [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) account for IPFS pinning
- A funded **Stellar testnet account** (use [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prissca/verdant-bond-protocol.git
cd verdant-bond-protocol

# Install API dependencies
cd api && npm install && cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Build all Soroban contracts
cd contracts && cargo build --release && cd ..
```

### Contributor Diagnostics

Before starting development or opening your first PR, it is highly recommended to run the read-only diagnostics script. This verifies your local environment, Node.js version, environment variables, Redis connectivity, and Postgres connectivity. It provides actionable remediation steps for any failures.

```bash
cd api
npm run diagnostics
```

### Quick Start (Testnet)

```bash
# 1. Configure environment
cp api/.env.example api/.env
# Edit api/.env with your Stellar keys and API credentials

# 2. Deploy contracts to testnet
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# 3. Start the API server
cd api && npm run start:dev

# 4. Start the Angular frontend
cd frontend && ng serve

# 5. Open the app
open http://localhost:4200
```

### Local Development Fixtures (Seeding)

The API serves list/detail pages (dashboard, projects, bonds, marketplace,
oracle) from a Redis cache that is normally populated by on-chain contract
calls. To develop without deployed contracts, you can seed the local cache with
a **deterministic, realistic fixture set** so every page renders meaningful data.

```bash
# Within the api package:
cd api

# 1. Ensure Redis is running (see docker-compose.yml).
# 2. Apply the fixtures (idempotent — skips if already seeded):
npm run seed

# Re-apply fixtures after changing them (overwrites seed keys):
npm run seed -- --force

# Clear all seeded keys and the seed marker:
npm run seed -- --reset
```

What gets seeded (all values are stable and repeatable across runs):

| Domain          | Fixtures                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users/roles     | 4 users covering admin, developer, investor, oracle-provider               |
| Projects        | 6 projects spanning every status and 4 credit methodologies                |
| Bonds           | 9 bonds across Active/Matured/**Defaulted** and all credit types           |
| Marketplace     | 6 orders covering every order status                                        |
| Oracle reports  | 11 reports across all report statuses, including one anchored to "now" so it is unambiguously overdue |
| Authorizations  | 3 delegated grants: active, expired-but-uncleaned, and revoked             |

The seed is idempotent (guarded by a `seed:verdant:marker` Redis key) and never
duplicates or clobbers unrelated keys. See `api/src/seed/fixtures.ts` for the
data and `api/scripts/seed.ts` for the CLI entry point.

**Edge cases covered for contributor testing** (issue #304): a **failed
settlement** (the Defaulted bond), **revoked access** (the revoked
authorization grant), an **overdue workflow** (the oracle report anchored to
`now` rather than the fixed fixture date), and **historical records** (the
matured legacy bond, created years before the fixture's anchor date). A
dedicated test suite, `api/src/seed/fixtures.consistency.spec.ts`, checks the
dataset's internal consistency (no dangling foreign ids, no duplicate ids,
correctly ordered timestamps) and that it is byte-identical across two builds.

### Wallet Authentication

The login flow uses a SEP-10-style challenge transaction. The API creates a
short-lived Stellar transaction containing a random nonce in a `ManageData`
operation, binds it to the configured network passphrase and home domain, and
signs it with `STELLAR_AUTH_SECRET_KEY`. Freighter signs that transaction
envelope and returns base64 XDR. The API verifies that the envelope matches the
stored challenge and contains valid signatures from both the server and the
requested wallet before issuing a JWT. Raw Ed25519 signatures and envelopes
from another Stellar network are rejected.

`STELLAR_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` must belong to the server authentication account and
must be kept private. `STELLAR_HOME_DOMAIN` should be the public host serving
the authentication endpoint in deployed environments.

## 🧪 Testing

### Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts

# Run all contract tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific contract
cargo test -p bond-issuer

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### API

```bash
cd api

# Unit tests
npm run test

# Integration tests (requires testnet connection)
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report
npm run test:cov
```

### End-to-End Lifecycle Testing

The repository includes a complete end-to-end lifecycle test harness that runs the full happy-path of the protocol (project registration, approval, bond issuance, subscription, oracle reporting, coupon distribution, DEX trading, and redemption) on Stellar Testnet.

To run the full E2E test with a single command:

```bash
./scripts/run-lifecycle-test.sh
```

This script automatically generates temporary wallets, funds them via Friendbot, builds and deploys the Soroban contracts, and executes the Jest test suite.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Unit tests
ng test

# E2E tests
ng e2e
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all contracts to Stellar testnet
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# The script writes contract addresses into .env automatically
# BOND_ISSUER_ADDRESS=C...
# COUPON_ENGINE_ADDRESS=C...
# etc.
```

### Mainnet Deployment

```bash
# Requires STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY in environment with sufficient XLM
# Always run a full audit before mainnet deployment

./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
```

### Docker

```bash
# Start all services (API + PostgreSQL + Redis)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

### Reproducible Builds

Releases must be reproducible: the same commit must yield the same Lockfiles,
WASM contract artifacts, and Node bundles on any machine or CI runner. A
committed, in-sync lockfile is the primary guarantee; drifting lockfiles or
uncommitted dependency resolutions are the leading cause of unreproducible
builds.

Run the self-contained reproducibility gate:

```bash
# Validates lockfile presence + sync for api/frontend/oracle, Cargo.lock for
# contracts, and (when the soroban CLI is available) contract WASM checksums:
./scripts/reproducibility/verify.sh
```

What each check enforces, and how to regenerate baselines:

| Check                                                     | Script                                                        | Baseline to commit              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Node lockfiles present & in sync (`npm ci --dry-run`)     | `scripts/reproducibility/lockfiles.sh`                        | `api|frontend|oracle/package-lock.json` |
| Rust workspace pinned                                     | `scripts/reproducibility/lockfiles.sh`                        | `contracts/Cargo.lock`          |
| Contract WASM artifact checksums                          | `scripts/reproducibility/wasm-checksums.sh --verify`          | `contracts/checksums.sha256`    |

Regenerating the contract WASM checksum baseline (only when artifacts
intentionally change):

```bash
./scripts/reproducibility/wasm-checksums.sh --generate
```

The CI pipeline runs `verify.sh` on every push/PR, so a commit that breaks
reproducibility (e.g. an out-of-sync lockfile) is blocked before merge, and
the `contracts` job re-verifies WASM checksums whenever the soroban CLI is
available in the build environment.

## 🏛️ Governance

Verdant Bond Protocol is governed by a multi-stakeholder committee comprising:

- **Project Developers** — Register and manage NbS projects
- **Bond Issuers** — Structure and issue bond tranches
- **Oracle Providers** — Submit ecological measurement data
- **Protocol Maintainers** — Core development team
- **Token Holders** — Investors holding active bond tokens

### Governance Actions

The following protocol parameters require multi-sig governance approval:

- Adding or removing oracle providers
- Updating credit conversion factors
- Deploying contract upgrades (subject to 48-hour timelock)
- Modifying KYC requirements
- Adjusting dispute resolution parameters

Governance proposals are submitted via on-chain transactions and ratified by a 3-of-5 multi-sig held across geographically distributed keyholders.

---

## ✅ Compliance & KYC

Verdant Bond Protocol takes a pragmatic approach to compliance:

- **KYC/AML** is handled off-chain via an integrated third-party provider before any investor may subscribe to a bond tranche
- **Accredited investor checks** are configurable per tranche by the bond issuer
- **Jurisdiction restrictions** can be encoded at the tranche level
- **On-chain identity** is abstracted — the smart contracts enforce KYC status via an allow-list maintained by the NestJS API, without storing personal data on-chain
- **Credit retirement certificates** are ICAO-compatible for corporate net-zero reporting
